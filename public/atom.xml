    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we announced Hungry Academy we promised to follow a model of open
education. We&#8217;d publish our curriculum, tutorials, projects, and
calendar.</p>

<p>This is the fulfillment of that promise. <a href="http://hungryacademy.com">HungryAcademy.com</a> will be the
hub for our activity. In the navigation above you find links to our
writings, calendar, and discussion forum. We expect these collections
and resources to change dramatically over the next few weeks as we
figure out what works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>If you want to become a developer, we invite you to follow along,
participate in our community, and learn to build amazing software.</p>
